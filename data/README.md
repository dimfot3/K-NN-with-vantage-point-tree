## data folder

Here you can place the data used to execute this project. There are two option to find the data.
1. You can create them following the instructions in scripts folder OR
2. You can download some samples from the url: ``https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wzwBYqBVDzDDZNHI38Y8gcxwLJUbfEC8/view?usp=sharing`` (~650MB).Note that these are small samples and for practical reason bigger datasets are easier to be created locally.
